# PRODIGY_DS_01 â€“ Bar Chart Visualization

This repository contains my submission for Task 1 of the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship.

## Task Objective
To create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable (such as age or gender) using Python.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Workflow
- Imported required libraries and loaded the dataset
- Performed basic data exploration
- Selected a variable for visualization (e.g., gender or age)
- Used Matplotlib to create a bar chart
- Styled the chart with labels and titles for better readability

## Learning Outcome
Successfully implemented a data visualization project using Python, focusing on how to represent distribution patterns clearly and effectively. Explored how categorical or continuous data can be better understood through simple yet powerful charts.

## Status
Task Completed
